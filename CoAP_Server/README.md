# COAP_Server

## coapserver

For setting up the Coap-Server, just execute the script `coapserver.py`. This sets up the COAP-Server with 3 Room Resources and one simple resource (If we needed to use it for something else.)

## SensorNode

The module `SensorNode.py` acts as the coap-endpoint and enters the data into the central database. The gathered data should then be accessible in the database.
